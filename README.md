# Bikesharing

## Overall Analysis ##

In this project I was tasked with collecting and interpreting data from the NY Citi Bike Program (A bike share program) to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal We used Tableau as a tool to  do POC on the data.In this interactive dashboard there are additional filters for the user to explore, gender and usertype.

## Summary ##

Overall, it appears for a Des Moines ride share to be successful.Breaking down the trips by usertype and gender, clearly shows that subscribers make up a large number of the trips, however customers tend to make longer trips. This makes sense because subscribers are every day commuters who probably commute to work only during the weekdays, whereas customers are most likely travelers who like to explore the city. However, it must be noted that within subscribers the gap between the number of trips made by each gender is large. Female subscribers make less trips than male subscribers. Therefore something must be done to attract more female riders. Looking over to the time breakdown, there is no difference between the usertype or genders. The popular time is between 4pm and 7pm, as concluded by previous phenomena analysis. The map shows an overlay of 2018 Male/Female Ratio data from the Census. It can be seen that majority of the stations exist in areas that are pretty balanced, so it really comes down to marketing and appealing the female riders. It may be possible to move the less popular stations to higher female population areas as well.
